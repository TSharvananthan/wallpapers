# Reminder Wallpapers
An archive of my reminder wallpapers.

# What?
I hate the feeling of forgetting something. Yet, I always forget things. I forget things to a point where it makes me mad. I thought to write down reminders. Except, I'm not a fan of writing on physical paper. It hurts my hand a tad too much for my liking. Call me a grumbler. Yet, the thought of writing on paper pains me to think about.

However, what else do I see all the time? My wallpaper. It's quite ugly. However, it gets the job done. It's easier to remember things when I see it everytime I boot up my PC.

You know what I don't hate? Archiving. Keeping a history of the past is cool. It feels like a time capsule at times. I go back to old pictures and get a chance to see what I was up to. This is an archive of my rememberings. Over time, things go away and things come back. However, the core idea still remains.

The archive can be found in the `/archive` directory. Feel free to take a glimpse. I did not include the script that powers this. I also didn't include my current wallpaper and its `.pdf` export. I don't see a reason to include them.

# How To Use
Just a glimpse of what I do to make this work. I would love to automate steps 1 and 2. However, Xournal doesn't support these features on the command line.

1. Edit the wallpaper in Xournal. 
2. Export it as as `wallpaper.pdf`.
3. Run `./update.sh`
